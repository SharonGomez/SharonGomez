## Hello, I'm Sharon. ðŸ¦­

I have been working as a gameplay programmer for the AAA title, Mafia: The Old Country, which is probably the coolest thing I have done in my life.
Here's the link to the trailer to the upcoming title ðŸ’ƒ.

I got this opportunity right after my Master's in Computer Science with a specialisation in Augmented and Virtual Reality from Trinity College Dublin. I also have nearly two years of experience as a web developer.
